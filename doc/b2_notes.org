HIRQ: Q=1, R4 p2h data available

PIRQ: I=1, R1 h2p data available
      J=1, R4 h2p data available

These two cases must be tracked independently, as the two status can
be reset independently.

PNMI: M=1, V=0, 1+ byte in R3 h2p
      M=1, V=1, 2 bytes in R3 h2p
      M=1, 0 bytes in R3 p2h

** TODO 1. Will clear PIRQ if register 1 was the source
** TODO 2. May activate PNMI depending on M and V flags
** TODO 3. May clear PNMI (see description of interrupt operation)
** TODO 4. Will clear HIRQ if it was active
** TODO 5. Will clear PIRQ if register 4 was the source

* Submodule notes

Where a submodule tracks a GitHub repo that's a fork, GitHub mostly
tracks the right source of the fork. Use the URL of the forked repo
(as shown on its GitHub repo page) as the ~upstream~ remote.

Because of the way submodules work, it's basically impossible to
remove one once it's been added, in case some historical revision
still uses it. So not all of them are actually used by the head
revision, but... hopefully... if you were to check out every single
revision of the repo, you'd find that every one was used at at least
one point.

Other submodule-specific notes:

** ~imgui~

This is a fork of the upstream repo, docking branch.

(For a long while it did track somebody else's fork
(https://github.com/Flix01/imgui/), which included some docking UI
functionality, but this appears to have been abandoned.

** ~SDL~

Unused submodule.

Fork of old mirror of SDL, plus a patch for rendering API-agnostic
triangle drawing. See https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/772

SDL then moved to GitHub, and its official repo turned out not to be
mergeable with this one.

** ~SDL_official~ (https://github.com/tom-seddon/SDL-1)

Fork of the official SDL repo.

* Turbo disc (RIP)

After 1770 sets DRQ, wait for CPU to read/write data register. Once
read/written, wait for CPU to execute next RTI. Then go to the next
byte straight away. Also: reduce settle and seek times. (Don't omit
the inter-sector delay, as Watford DDFS needs it.)

This involved a bunch of code in a bunch of places, and ended up a
special case, being a runtime toggle (that affected reproducibility)
rather than part of the BeebConfig. And I never tested it enough to
promote it.

It could return, but probably won't... there are better ways of
providing fast file access, that b2 should probably support instead -
BeebLink (etc.), B-em's VDFS (etc.), (if you want ADFS) some kind of
hard disc emulation, and so on.

* Debugger paging override syntax

When providing an address, by default the debugger accesses whichever
byte of memory is paged in at the time. If you access address 8003,
for example, you could get any one of 16 paged ROMs, or (on B+/Master)
some of the extra RAM, depending on the value of ROMSEL.

If you want to refer to a particular byte, unambiguously, you can use
the paging override syntax. This consists of a prefix, specifying
which bits of paged memory are paged in, then a ~.~, then the address.
For example, ~5.8003~, to refer to address 8003 in ROM bank 5.

The available prefixes are as follows:

- ~0~, ~1~, ~2~, ~3~, ~4~, ~5~, ~6~, ~7~, ~8~, ~9~, ~a~, ~b~, ~c~, ~d~, ~e~, ~f~,  - the given ROM bank
- ~n~ - ANDY (Master), extra 12K RAM (B+)
- ~m~, ~s~ - main RAM or shadow RAM
- ~h~ - HAZEL (Master)
- ~i~ - I/O area (only useful on Master)
- ~o~ - OS

prefix precedence? overlapping areas??

* config versioning notes

Tag each default config with a feature name, a string

When saving: save off features seen in all configs

When loading: any default configs with an unseen feature are added to
the list. And the cycle repeats.

Configs predating the feature mechanism - i.e., the stock B/B+/M128
set - are marked by having an empty feature name., They never get
re-added.

* notes about why stuff is in one of ~BBCMicro~ or ~BeebThread~ rather than the other 

Saved states/rewind/timeline/etc. is supposed to be at heart managed
by copying ~BBCMicro~ objects. So anything that affects
reproducibility has to be part of that. Hence pasting state being in
~BBCMicro~.

But ~BBCMicro~ should also have no more functionality in it than
necessary, so which is why the trace stuff is just start/stop on the
BBCMicro class and then a pile of junk in BeebThread to handle the
various start and stop conditions.

Would be nice to get the instruction/write callbacks out of BBCMicro
too, since in theory the BeebThread could do that bit. But having them
there does mean they can be easily stripped out of the templated
Update functions via ~if constexpr~, meaning no overhead when not
updating.

Could maybe template the BeebThread update function, along similar
lines? The stretch flag complicates that a bit, though.

* b2 UEF save state extra stuff

** Memory chunks

May as well reuse the BeebEm memory state and sideways ROM chunks,
though it might be nice to tidy up the shadow RAM while doing it.
Maybe just save all 32 KB of shadow RAM and skip the separate
private/FS RAM chunks?

** 6502 stuff

Cycle count for each 6502 is unnecessary, as there's a global one for
the entire system. Include that as part of some global system state
chunk that also holds machine type.

For saving 6502 state, it must be possible to save it on any cycle
boundary (pretty much) - the entire state will have to be saved. Can't
cheat by trying to put the 6502 to a known point, because it'll only
end up with the same issue as issue #2 for BeebEm compat...

The only complicated bit here is the tfn/ifn pointers, but
=g_named_ifns= and =g_name_tfns= to the rescue (hopefully). I'm not
certain there are no holes in the table, though - could this be
detected statically? Accesses to it are not really
performance-sensitive. (Answer: looks like it'd be possible to do at
least something, but a bit hard to guarantee the tables are set up
properly. Would be easier if it were C++. For now, can advance the
system cycle by cycle until all have known names, and flag any problem
cases.)

** VIA stuff

b2 will need to save more stuff than there's room for in the
BeebEm-format chunk.

** Sound stuff

The BeebEm stuff might be good?

** Video stuff

The 

* b2/BeebEm UEF save state compat stuff

Limitations if saving BeebEm-compatible state:

1. Can't save during 1770 operation, as the b2 internal state doesn't
   map to the BeebEm FDCCommand stuff. Probably no bad thing

2. Can't reliably save with second processor, as it may not be
   possible to advance tho emulation to a point where both CPUs are
   about to fetch an instruction

3. Have to fake the FDC DLL name

4. NMILock ain't a thing so it'll probably have to be saved as 0

5. Might not work anyway...!

Loading BeebEm-compatible states should be easy enough, probably.
Restrictions:

1. Note unsupported hardware (Master ET, 8271, Z80, Music 5000, etc.)

2. Can't load if 1770 active

=FDCCommand= is the state in BeebEm's internal 1770 state machine,
which is probably going to be a bit painful to map to anything in b2
(or vice versa). So perhaps it'll be safest just to insist on the 1770
being idle when saving or loading a BeebEm-compatible state. I think
an FDCCommand of 0 indicatse that the 1770 is waiting for a command.

FDCDLL probably easiest handled by checking the file name part, which
needs to be one of:

- `Acorn1770.dll` :: Acorn 1770
- `OpusDDOS.dll` :: Opus 1770
- `Watford.dll` :: Watford DDB2

*** Other notes

=PARASITE_BIG_PAGE_INDEX= is used in update function to check for
breakpoints.

=MOS_BIG_PAGE_INDEX= is used in debugger code when showing the paging
setup.

** Status <2024-07-05 Fri>

Big page tables should be set up correctly. Regardless of mapper type,
the big page index is bank*32+region*4+bigpage.

ReadOnlyBigPage structs should be set up correctly. There's a new
function, =GetROMOffset=, that handles the details.

Mapper port access should work... maybe... there's a new =if
constexpr= inside =BBCMicro::Update=. This calls =UpdatePaging= to
sort out a new big page arrangement. No need to worry about switching
update function: that's impossible in this case. Access to mapper IO
can only change the paging. Code needs to access ROMSEL to switch to a
different update function due to switching to a different mapper, and
that's now handled with an additional =UpdateCPUDataBusFn= call in
=BBCMicro::WriteROMSEL=.

=UpdateCPUDataBusFn= has been updated to take the mapper type into
account.

TODOs

*** DONE don't allow writeable slot unless 16 KB
CLOSED: [2024-07-06 Sat 21:55]

etc., etc. - make sure the UI makes this clear

*** DONE NUM_BIG_PAGES is now a LOT
CLOSED: [2024-07-06 Sat 21:54]

Go through anywhere it's used to size arrays, and eliminate anything
that's now far too large.

Conclusion: probably going to leave this. Major offenders are:

- BBCMicro :: not a big deal, as there's only one of these per running
  emulator

- BBCMicro::DebugState :: this is now a slightly monstrous 2 MBytes
  plus, but, ditto. 

- BreakpointsDebugWindow :: another singleton

4 MBytes just ain't that much these days...

*** DONE NUM_UPDATE_MFNS is now a LOT
CLOSED: [2024-07-06 Sat 21:54]

Ditto.

Conclusion: ditto, but the sizeof BBCMicro::UpdateMFnsData is realy a
bit ridiculous!

Use a std::map or similar for this instead? It would only need
re-examining when the update mfn actually changes.

Or what about a remap table, so only the unique functions need to be
counted. This could be built up at runtime by scanning the update_mfns
table.

*** DONE Use GetROMBankCode where appropriate
CLOSED: [2024-07-06 Sat 21:56]

Remove all the occurrences of "%x" for this purpose.

Other possibilities: merge parasite special into parasite type. 5. Set
c.

But, ultimately, this is only reducing the size of the tables. The
number of actual routines will necessarily remain the same. So does it
actually matter?

A 512 KB table (that's 90% unused) is kind of dumb, but for a modern
PC it's basically irrelevant.

** Version changes

AVCodec::ch_layouts - introduced in FFmpeg6, LIBAVCODEC_VERSION_MAJOR>=60

*** No member named 'codec' in 'AVStream'

Changed in ffmpeg5.

Use =codecpar= instead.

*** No member named 'channels' in 'AVCodecContext'

Changed in ffmpeg6.

I _think_ this is covered by the nb_channels field in the new
AVChannelLayout struct...

*** No member named 'channel_layout' in 'AVFrame'; No member named 'channel_layout' in 'AVCodecContext'

Changed in ffmpeg6.

Use ch_layout instead.

: * Copying an AVChannelLayout via assigning is forbidden,
: * av_channel_layout_copy() must be used instead (and its return value should
: * be checked)

int av_channel_layout_copy(AVChannelLayout *dst, const AVChannelLayout *src);

Regarding =AV_CH_LAYOUT_MONO= and so on, there is
=AV_CHANNEL_LAYOUT_STEREO= (etc.), macros that expand to struct
literals. So this can be used to create fodder for the copy function.

#+begin_src c++
  const AVChannelLayout LAYOUT_MONO=AV_CHANNEL_LAYOUT_MONO;
  const AVChannelLayout LAYOUT_STEREO=AV_CHANNEL_LAYOUT_STEREO;
  TEST_AV(av_channel_layout_copy(&ac_context->ch_layout,wav_fmt->nChannels==1?&LAYOUT_MONO:&LAYOUT_STEREO));
#+end_src

(The naming is annoyingly wonky.)

*** Undefined 'av_get_channel_layout_string'
*** No member named 'channel_layouts' in 'AVCodec'

FFmpeg5:

 * @deprecated use av_channel_layout_describe()
